## Weather-application

## Description 

 This project consists in a web weather application.
 It gives the user the opportunity to search for the weather for a desired city. 
 To retrieve weather data, the OpenWeather APIs have been used.


 The web application works as follows:
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
  
 The website will look like the photo below on the first visit, showing the browser history:

and will look like in the photo below, once a button is pressed or a new search is requested.
